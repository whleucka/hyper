👷 *Currently under development*

❌ **Not for production use**


### Getting Started

To get started with Nebula, follow these steps:


- **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using Composer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/libra-php/nebula.git
cd nebula
composer install
```

- **Configuration**: Customize the configuration files according to your project requirements, including database settings and configurations. If you're starting a new project, then copy the example env configuration.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- **Dependencies**: The application has the following dependencies:

    - Redis: caching, rate limiting
    - MySQL: database

- **Note**: you may enable/disable application behaviour in `/app/Config`

- **Development**: Start building your application by creating controllers, views, and models within the `src` directory. 
Hint: You can start a local development server by running `./nebula -s`

### Admin Backend

WIP: Nebula comes fully equipped with a sophisticated admin backend, easily accessible through the `/admin/sign-in` route. The power to enable or disable user registration rests in your hands, effortlessly adjustable within the `.env` configuration using the `ADMIN_REGISTER_ENABLED=true` toggle. Once authentication is successfully established, users are seamlessly guided to the `/admin/module/dashboard` destination. Nevertheless, the flexibility to tailor this redirection to harmonize with your application's unique specifications remains entirely at your disposal.
